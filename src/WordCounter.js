/**
 * In this exercise:
 *  This function accepts array of words.
 *  You need to implement it so it returns object that has one property corresponding to each unique word in passed list.
 *  Value for such property should indicate how many times, this word is used in accepted array.
 *  For example:
 *      If we get array: ['word1', 'word2', 'word1', 'word3'],
 *      Then we return object:
 *          {
 *              word1: 2,
 *              word2: 1,
 *              word3: 1
 *          }
