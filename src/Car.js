/**
 * In this exercise, you need to:
 * Modify this function to return object (it WILL NOT be used as constructor) that mimics class with private fields.
 * It should look like this:
 *  {
 *      getFuelLevel(),
 *      driveFor(km)
 *  }
 * GetFuelLevel() - returns how much fuel is left in tank in percent
 * DriveFor(km) - should burn fuel according to fuelBurnForKm
 *
 * This object CANNOT have properties maxFuel, fuelBurtPerKm and currentFuel.
 *
 * Hint: use clousers.
